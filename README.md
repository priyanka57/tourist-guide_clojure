# tourist-guide_clojure

Created a hybrid web and desktop application in Clojure dynamic programming language to help the tourists see and print the information about 10 best tourist cities of the world. The application showed the best restaurants, hotels and attractions along with their Google Map interactive map location. The code also created .pdf version of all the information stored. 

The project was a team work of Priyanka, Rasha and Tahani, CU Boulder CS Grad students. 

To run the code, you need to download the whole folder. Make sure Clojure, lein and all the supported libraries are already installed in your system. 

"lein run" will run the application.
